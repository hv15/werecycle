# About #

This project is a result of the [Heriot-Watt University](http://www.hw.ac.uk/) [Hackathon competition](http://www.drpawel.co.uk/participate/category/hwhackathon/). The goal of this competition is to create a not-for-profit app that helps in the following areas: Community, Charity and Environment.

We hope that this project will fulfill these requirements successfully. More than that though, we hope it _saves the world one step at a time_.

~~The project is to be completed by Wednesday, 19th of September.~~
We completed the webapp on time. However the project is long from over. We plan to expand our data set to the rest of the UK. Furthermore, we are in the process of creating a _native_ app for Android!
