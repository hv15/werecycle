# List of the recyclables with detailed information #

**common**
  * 1 _Household metal packaging_
    * Drink cans are usually made from aluminium and food cans are usually made from steel.
    * There may be a symbol, such as an alu mark, on the product to indicate what metal it is made from.
    * You can test which metal your waste is by using a magnet. Aluminium metal is non-magnetic whereas steel is magnetic.
    * Make sure drink and food cans are clean before recycling.
    * Find out if there is a ‘cash for cans’ scheme operating near you.

  * 2 _cardboard_
    * Keep large cardboard boxes whenever you move house – even if you don’t plan to move again, your friends or neighbours might need them.
    * Your local school or playgroup may use cardboard boxes for craft projects.
    * Use a cardboard box to collect your other recycling in – then you won’t have to separate it later!

  * 6 _glass bottles & jars_
    * Glass is separated into 3 colours: green, brown and clear.
    * Take great care when handling broken glass, wear gloves if possible.
    * Deposit glass at your nearest recycling bank by throwing them into the appropriate container.
    * Make sure you wash out the bottle or jar before putting it into recycling bins.
    * Reuse glass whenever possible. Jars can be used as small containers and bottles can be used as vases.
    * ![http://www.recycling-guide.org.uk/files/2010/11/glass-big.gif](http://www.recycling-guide.org.uk/files/2010/11/glass-big.gif)
  * 7 _paper_
    * Reduce paper waste by cancelling unwanted deliveries, or read news online as opposed to buying newspapers.
    * Put a ‘no junk mail please’ sign on your letter box to reduce unwanted deliveries.
    * Reuse paper around the home as scrap paper or packing material. Envelopes can also be reused.
    * Set your printer to print on both sides of the paper.
    * Buy recycled paper whenever possible.
    * ![http://www.recycling-guide.org.uk/files/2010/11/paper-big.gif](http://www.recycling-guide.org.uk/files/2010/11/paper-big.gif)
  * 13 _yellow pages_
    * Contrary to popular belief, Yellow pages are in fact made from white paper! The yellow colour is just ink printed in the same way as the adverts themselves.
    * Yellow Pages encourage the ‘Yellow Woods Campaign’ which is an educational way for children to learn about the benefits of recycling and also to encourage woodland development. Yellow Pages even provide the opportunity to win cash prizes and also support the woodland trust on a pound for pound basis.

  * 16 _plastic bottles_
    * Clean bottles before recycling them.
    * Buy plastic bottles in bulk whenever possible to reduce packaging waste.
    * Carriers can be reused next time you’re at the shops.
    * ![http://www.recycling-guide.org.uk/files/2010/11/plastic-big.gif](http://www.recycling-guide.org.uk/files/2010/11/plastic-big.gif)
  * 17 _cartons_
    * The carton is a light weight, easily transported, energy saving and biodegradable packaging type.
    * Cartons cannot be recycled indefinitely but they can be recycled around six to eight times before the fibres weaken.
    * Once recycled the cartons are transformed into a variety of paper based products.
    * ![http://www.wasteconnect.co.uk/imageResize.aspx?chrOrin=X&intSize=155&strFile=E:\wasteconnect\aspx\images\carton_18042011100835.jpg](http://www.wasteconnect.co.uk/imageResize.aspx?chrOrin=X&intSize=155&strFile=E:\wasteconnect\aspx\images\carton_18042011100835.jpg)
  * 29 _aerosol cans_
    * Aerosol containers can be recycled, but only when they are completely empty.
    * Aerosols can be stored for a long time so hold on to a half empty can if possible.
    * Do not pierce, crush or flatten the aerosol before recycling.
    * Also, detach any loose or easily removable parts, such as the lid, and dispose of them with the rest of your rubbish.
    * ![http://www.recyclenow.com/images/hi_res/14375_1.png](http://www.recyclenow.com/images/hi_res/14375_1.png)
  * 41 _aluminium foil_
    * Always wash your kitchen foil thoroughly before recycling.
    * If you collect drinks cans as part of a [Cash for Cans scheme](http://www.cashforcans.co.uk/), you may be able to sell used aluminium foil too.
    * As well as foil, you can also recycle these other aluminium items:
      * Milk bottle tops
      * Barbeque and freezing trays
      * Cigarette and tobacco foil
      * Screw top lids from wine bottles
    * ![http://www.recyclenow.com/images/hi_res/14546_tin-foil.png](http://www.recyclenow.com/images/hi_res/14546_tin-foil.png)
**electric (all RC)**
  * 26: _energy saving light bulbs & fluorescent tubes_
    * These save you money and help the environment by using less electricity.
    * At the same time you are also reducing the quantity of waste, because they don't need to be replaced as often as ordinary bulbs.
    * The mercury from only one fluorescent tube can contaminate up to 30,000 litres of water beyond a safe standard for drinking.
    * Fluorescent tube recycling makes economic use of all components
    * ![http://envirogreen-px.rtrk.co.uk/images/ftubes.jpg](http://envirogreen-px.rtrk.co.uk/images/ftubes.jpg)
  * 30: _large electrical appliances_
    * Most electrical equipment can be reused or broken down into parts.
    * If the electrical equipment is still in full working order, sell it in a car boot sale or donate it to a charity shop.
    * Contact your retailer as they may take back old products.
    * Always try to repair items rather than throwing them away, others may find a use for the item when you no longer want it.
    * Try to buy electrical items that have a long life span.
    * ![http://www.recycling-guide.org.uk/files/2010/11/electricalequipment-big.gif](http://www.recycling-guide.org.uk/files/2010/11/electricalequipment-big.gif)
  * 32: _batteries_
    * http://www.recycling-guide.org.uk/files/2010/11/batteries-big.gif?1243605540
    * All waste batteries are classified as hazardous waste and recycling is always the best option.
    * Ordinary household batteries do contain some hazardous chemicals so ideally should not be thrown out with the day to day rubbish.
    * Rechargeable batteries contain harmful metals, so should never be thrown away with daily rubbish, they should be returned to manufacturer for disposal or recycled elsewhere.
  * 38: _car & engine batteries_
    * Car batteries, by law, must not be disposed of with household waste.
    * Battery acid can burn clothing and skin and even cause blindness if it leaks, so wear protective clothing when inspecting a battery prior to disconnection/transportation.
    * Disconnect the battery before inspecting it.
    * The battery can be fairly heavy, so be careful when lifting and carrying the battery, seek assistance if required.
    * ![http://www.recyclenow.com/images/hi_res/14526_car-batteries.png](http://www.recyclenow.com/images/hi_res/14526_car-batteries.png)
  * 40: _fridge & freezers_
    * Your local authority will also collect bulky white goods items such as fridges and washing machines for you, although they may charge you for this service.
    * If your appliance is still in good working order, a member of [Freecycle](http://www.freecycle.org/) may also be grateful to take it.
    * There are also community organisations who accept donations of used white goods in order to pass them onto someone else:
      * [Furniture Reuse Network](http://www.frn.org.uk/)
      * [CREATE](http://www.createuk.com/)
      * [The SOFA Project](http://www.sofaproject.org.uk/site/1.asp)
    * ![http://www.recyclenow.com/images/hi_res/14551_fridge-freezer.png](http://www.recyclenow.com/images/hi_res/14551_fridge-freezer.png)
  * 45: _small appliances_
    * For every 7kg of small electricals bought last year - the average amount per person - only a fraction (1.3kg) was sent to be recycled
    * Recycling electricals is environmentally friendly – unwanted electricals and electronics can be recycled and contain really valuable raw materials.
    * Items that are still in working order can be reused. Organisations such as the [British Heart Foundation](http://www.bhf.org.uk/surveys/BigDonationFE.html).
    * Electrical items contain a range of materials that can be separated for recycling and used in new products, such as plastics and precious metals including gold and copper.
    * ![http://www.thisissomerset.co.uk/images/localpeople/ugc-images/275793/Article/images/16185486/3816695.png](http://www.thisissomerset.co.uk/images/localpeople/ugc-images/275793/Article/images/16185486/3816695.png)
  * 46: _TVs & monitors_
    * As part of the UK’s digital switchover you do not need to get a new TV – virtually any TV can be upgraded to digital using a digital box which are available from around £20.
    * [Freecycle](http://www.freecycle.org/) is a non-profit movement that encourages people to give things for free in their local community.
    * You may also be able to sell your television or monitor - try advertising in a local paper or notice board.
    * ![http://www.recyclenow.com/images/hi_res/14560_tv.png](http://www.recyclenow.com/images/hi_res/14560_tv.png)
**building/garden materials**
  * 04: _garden waste_
    * If you are taking your garden waste to your local recycling centre, use a strong, durable bag (not a black bin liner) and do not overfill it.
    * But why take it out of your garden at all? Compost at home, and you can recycle it yourself.
    * The council does not accept garden waste in the normal household refuse collection.
    * ![http://www.scarborough.gov.uk/images/recycling_garden_graphic.jpg](http://www.scarborough.gov.uk/images/recycling_garden_graphic.jpg)
  * 09: _scrap metals_
    * Remember to recycle drinks cans when away from home - i.e. at work, while travelling or at sports and leisure locations.
    * Steel can be recycled time and time again without loss of quality; by simply recycling our steel cans we can conserve non-renewable fossil fuels, reduce the consumption of energy and the emission of gasses like carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
    * Steel can be infinitely recycled and because it is such a widely used material, the ranges of possible uses for it are endless.
    * ![http://www.mobile-metals.co.uk/resources/aaaaab.jpg](http://www.mobile-metals.co.uk/resources/aaaaab.jpg)
  * 12: _wood & timber_
    * Wood can often be reused to make other items, such as a bird table for your garden.
    * Wood can often be added to your compost heap, such as sawdust and wood shavings.
    * Buy recycled wood whenever possible.
    * http://www.recycling-guide.org.uk/files/2010/11/wood-big.gif?1215160912
  * 33: _hard-core & rubble_
    * Sell it!  Building materials are always in demand. Advertise in local papers or on community noticeboards.
    * Donate it!  A community project near you may have a use for your building bits and pieces.
    * All rubble must also be broken down in advance.
    * If you`re doing building work, please plan in advance where you can recycle your hardcore or hire a skip for rubble.

**various/other**
  * 3: _engine oil_
    * Waste such as paint, paintbrushes, car oil and oil filters have to be carefully disposed of, as they can be very damaging to the environment.
    * Don’t pour oil or paint down the drain.
    * Civic amenity sites often take engine oil for recycling.
    * Buy products in bulk whenever possible to reduce packaging waste.
    * Use eco-friendly alternatives whenever possible.
  * 11: _clothing_
    * Donate old clothes to charity shops or take them to a jumble sale.

    * ![http://www.recycling-guide.org.uk/files/2010/11/textiles-big.gif](http://www.recycling-guide.org.uk/files/2010/11/textiles-big.gif)
  * 18: _books_
    * Books can't usually be recycled along with other paper recycling because of the glue that's used to bind them.
    * Most charity shops will accept second hand books if they are in good condition, as will some libraries.
    * Try local second hand book dealers, jumble sales or car boot sales.
    * You can also sell or swap your books online:
      * [Green Metropolis](http://www.greenmetropolis.com/)
      * [Amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/)
      * [Book Crossing](http://www.bookcrossing.com/)
    * ![http://www.recyclenow.com/images/hi_res/14520_books.png](http://www.recyclenow.com/images/hi_res/14520_books.png)
  * 22: _tyres_
    * Tyres are not desired at landfills, due to their large volumes and 75% void space, which quickly consumes valuable space.
    * Tyre stockpiles create a great health and safety risk. Tyre fires can occur easily, burning for months, creating substantial pollution in the air and ground. Recycling helps to reduce the number of tyres in storage.
    * Tyres often have multiple lives too. To get some car tyres with a history, use retreads and feel good about saving a rubber tree: [Retread Manufacturers Association](http://www.retreaders.org.uk/).
    * ![http://www.mobiusenviro.com/wp-content/uploads/ultimate-best-tyre-recycling-technologies.jpg](http://www.mobiusenviro.com/wp-content/uploads/ultimate-best-tyre-recycling-technologies.jpg)

    * ![http://www.recycling-guide.org.uk/files/2010/11/furniture-big.gif](http://www.recycling-guide.org.uk/files/2010/11/furniture-big.gif)
  * 25: _DVDs, CDs, videos & tapes_
    * Crafters have used the tape for crocheting or weaving. The resulting fabric if often used for retro-style bags or purse. Gardeners also use strips of video to deter birds from attacking seedlings.
    * Offer pre-recorded videos to your local charity shop or on [Freecycle](http://www.freecycle.org/) – not everyone’s made the switch to DVD and it’s a cheap way for them to pick up entertainment for free/cheap. Some charity shops don’t accept them any more because no one buys them – it differs from shop to shop and between areas.
    * Only burn new discs when you really need it to – use reusable USB keys or internet storage where possible instead.
    * Use CDs/DVDs as modern day scarecrows to deter birds from your veg plot or fruit trees. Or you can use them in crafts – they can be made into drop spindles for spinning wool or as a base for gift bags (see below).
    * ![http://www.recyclethis.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/compactdiscs250.jpg](http://www.recyclethis.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/compactdiscs250.jpg)
  * 27: _paint_

  * 43: _shoes_
    * When donating shoes, make sure they are tied together so they don’t separate.
    * Before you donate your old shoes be sure to tie them together in pairs as they can easily get separated and single shoes can’t be sold on.
    * Refashioning or repairing old shoes can be far cheaper than buying a new pair.
    * Some sportswear companies are collecting athletic shoes in any state. They are then converted into basketball courts, tennis courts and running tracks.
    * ![http://www.recyclenow.com/images/hi_res/14543_shoes.png](http://www.recyclenow.com/images/hi_res/14543_shoes.png)
